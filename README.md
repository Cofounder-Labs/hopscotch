# Universal Overlay Assistant

A lightweight macOS utility that grants large-language-model agents the ability to draw on-screen annotations and observe user interactions anywhere on the desktop.

## Features

- **Act Mode**: Draw on-screen annotations (highlight rectangles) at specified coordinates over any application
- **Observe Mode**: Monitor user clicks within specified regions and receive callbacks
- **Permission Handling**: Manages macOS privacy permissions (Accessibility, Screen Recording, Input Monitoring)
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Toggle between modes and check permission status via the menu bar
- **CLI Control**: Control the overlay assistant via the `overlayctl` command-line tool

## System Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel-based Mac
- Xcode 13.0 or later (for development)

## Installation

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

The `overlayctl` command-line tool can be used to control the overlay assistant:

```bash
# Draw a rectangle annotation at x=100, y=200 with width=300, height=100 in the Finder app
overlayctl act 100 200 300 100 com.apple.finder

# Monitor clicks in a region at x=500, y=600 with width=200, height=150
overlayctl observe 500 600 200 150

# Switch to Act mode
overlayctl mode act

# Switch to Observe mode
overlayctl mode observe
```
